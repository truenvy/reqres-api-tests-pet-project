# Reqres API test pet-project

## Build the project

```mvn clean install -Dmaven.test.skip=true```

Downloads the specs, generates the models and compiles the code.

## Design Patterns and Approaches

### Design Patterns

#### BaseTest Class

The BaseTest Class or Test Case Superclass is a testing pattern to reuse test-specific logic normally related to pre- and
post-conditions.

#### Object Mother/Data Factory Class

The Object Mother is a kind of class used in testing to help create example objects that you use for testing, where I
can use the Factory pattern to easily generate the example objects.


#### Builder

Builder is a creational design pattern, which allows the construction of complex objects step by step. It can be used to
organize any group of classes, but I commonly use it in Model and Query Parameter objects.

### Approaches

#### Auto-generate clients from OpenAPI specification

To avoid the re-implementation of the API calls to the microservices I will use the Open API specification file from
the services to auto-generate the base client.

#### Hiding auto-generated clients using custom asserters

I could use the client class in the test. In this case, I would add the correct return instead of the generic Response
from Rest-Assured. This is doable but will add more code maintenance, so I decided to add a new (last one) abstraction
layer.

The asserters abstraction will contain a set of methods interacting with the client methods, asserting it instantly and
returning itself for chaining the methods.

#### Separation of constant and dynamic data

I am defining here a separation of the data used: changeless and dynamic.

* changeless: constant data used in different classes
* dynamic: the implementation of the Object Mother/Data Factory class

## Run the tests

### Via command line

Run the following command in order to run the tests

```mvn clean test```

Run the following command in order to generate Allure report

```
allure serve target/allure-results
```

### Via Docker

Build a docker image based on the Dockerfile in the root directory

```
docker build -t reqres-api-tests .
```

Run the docker container based on the built image

```
docker run -it --rm -p 8080:8080 reqres-api-tests
```
